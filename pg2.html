		<h1>How to Buy a Desktop PC</h1>

		<section class="col3">
			<p>Does your desktop PC take so long to start up you have time to go get a cup of coffee (and drink it!) before you can get moving? Tried installing the latest game only to find out your graphics card is six generations too old to play it? Or maybe you just want to take advantage of the speed and reliability of operating systems like Microsoft Windows 8.1 and OS X Yosemite. If any of these are true, then it is time for you to buy a new system. And we can help you do it.</P>
			<p>Prices for new desktop PCs start as low as $200 and range all the way up to and over $5,000, but most of us would be more than happy with a $500 to $750 box, including monitor. You still need to make some choices when it comes to CPUs, memory, hard drive capacity and graphics technology, but the good news is your money has never gone further. And a PC you buy today could very well last you for three to five years.</p>
			<h2>Back to Basics</h2>
			<p>It's getting to the point where basic PCs are in the same price range as some tablets. While it's certainly possible to do most of your Web surfing and video watching on a tablet, it's often better to do real work on a desktop PC. This is especially the case when you need to view your work on a larger screen, like when you're editing a long Word document or when you've got a huge spreadsheet to work on. You'll find AMD e-class and A4/A6 processors as well as Intel Core i3 and i5 processors in inexpensive systems. If all you want to do is surf the Web, run Office apps, and do light to moderate computing duties, you should consider one of these compact systems.</p>
			<p>You can find basic systems advertised for as low as $200 without monitor. These systems belong to a desktop category that (mostly) comes in below the $300-$500 value desktop categories, both in price and capabilities. These systems run on the inexpensive, basic components that keep the prices affordable: low-powered processors like the Intel Atom, Intel Celeron, Intel Pentium, AMD Athlon E-series and AMD Sempron processors; non-upgradable integrated graphics; 1GB to 4GB of RAM; smaller hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD); no optical drive (usually); and Windows 7/8, Linux operating system, Android, Chrome OS, or sometimes even no pre-installed OS. While inexpensive desktops are being eclipsed by tablets and other mobile systems, you'll still find inexpensive compact systems in big box stores and online retailers when you search for cheap PCs.</p>
			<p>Some budget systems have a built-in screen and still can be bought for less than $500. You'll also see quite a few compact mini PCs aimed at the home theater crowd, some of which may be up to $600 if they include built-in Blu-ray drives. They work well in a living room because they're silent (quiet fans); have wireless keyboards and/or mice; and have HDMI ports for connecting to HDTVs. They're still one of the easiest ways to get IPTV services like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube on your HDTV in the living room, plus you can comfortably surf the Web from your couch on a mini PC with a wireless keyboard and mouse. HD video playback on a mini desktop is smooth when playback is the only task running; but forget about multitasking while viewing videos: once you bring up a rich website with heavy Adobe Flash, the video quality will suffer.</p>
			<p>There's a subset of really inexpensive systems (under $200), which leverage online storage and apps replacing local storage and Windows/Mac-based applications. These systems can be an option if your world is completely online, but note that Chrome OS can't run Windows programs natively, and you'll need an always-on connection at home to use cloud-based systems like the ChromeBox effectively. Windows systems in this price range may have very little local storage, so plan to take advantage of online storage for your files. For our top picks for inexpensive systems, take a look at our budget desktops roundup.</p>
			<h2>Midrange Desktop PCs</h2>
			<p>Sub-$600 PCs used to be the bargain basement for desktops, but now they're the norm. You should be able to find a desktop that has a recent multi-core processor and 4GB to 6GB of RAM for under $600 with an LCD monitor. The multi-core CPU with integrated graphics will help with the increasingly complex tasks that even casual users expect of their PCs. These include converting video from one format to another (so you can view it on your cell phone, for example), or light photo editing like removing red eye, cropping, or even recomposing the layout of a picture by adding missing people or changing colors in a shot.</p>
			<p>You'll sometimes find Intel Pentium or AMD Athlon processors at this price level, but lately you'll find more powerful Intel Core i3/i5, or AMD A4/A6 processors with even more capabilities. Many come with hard drives of substantial capacity (500GB or more). Like on some laptops, you'll find SSDs and hybrid SSD/HDD combos that will speed up your work. Buy a system with an SSD if you are really impatient, but note that SSDs are still somewhat lacking in storage for heavy downloaders and graphics mavens. Some of these PCs still come in minitower cases, but the sexier ones come in small form factor cases, ultra small form factors, or better yet, mini PC form factors. These cases take up much less room on your desk than a traditional minitower, and are just as functional as their larger counterparts. Plus, a good budget PC should easily last you the next three to five years.</p>
